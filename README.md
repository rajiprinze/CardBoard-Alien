This is a new start up App project that is happening


Steps : 

  Some basic ideas for this project to progress :
  
  1] We would like to build a website that will keep a summary of all the books that teach important CS concepts. 
      After summarizing those books, we can then move forward and allow people to take quizzed on important concepts.
      There are many websited like this already. But this is meant to be interactive and CS focused. 
      
  2] We woud like to create an application that would allow users to make a post to all the social media options available.
      They you indeed first have to loging with all the credentials accounts and we could keep secure information.
      When they make a post we can allow the options of where to post them, and groups to post to and many other options. 
      There are similar apps like this, but none really that cater to this specific action. Might be useful to have that
      option in one app. 
  3] Language has always been a common interest between us. So maybe we could go back to out old ideas of language and
      and interactive learning device, or something like that. Haha.
